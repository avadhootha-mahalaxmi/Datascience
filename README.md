*Objective:*
Developed a machine learning model to predict restaurant ratings on the Zomato app based on various features such as cuisine type, location, cost for two, and user reviews.

*Key Responsibilities:*
- *Data Collection and Preprocessing:* 
  - Collected and cleaned large datasets of restaurant information from the Zomato API.
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering to enhance predictive power.
  
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
  - Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand data distribution and relationships between features.
  - Visualized data using matplotlib and seaborn to uncover trends and insights.

- *Model Development:*
  - Implemented various machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decisiontree ,ExtraTreesRegressor)
    to predict restaurant ratings.
  - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

- *Model Evaluation:*
  - Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
  - Selected the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

- *Deployment:*
  - Developed a user-friendly interface for prediction using Flask.
  - Deployed the model as a RESTful API, integrating it with the Zomato app frontend for real-time rating predictions.

- *Documentation and Reporting:*
  - Created comprehensive project documentation detailing methodologies, code, and results.
  - Presented findings to stakeholders with actionable insights for improving user experience on the Zomato app.

*Technologies Used:*
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, Zomato API
  

*Outcome:*
Successfully built and deployed a robust model with a high accuracy rate, significantly aiding in the enhancement of personalized restaurant recommendations on the Zomato app.
